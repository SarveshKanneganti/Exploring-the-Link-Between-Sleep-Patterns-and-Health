Rest to Recovery: Exploring the Link Between Sleep Patterns and Health

📌 Project Overview

This Tableau project explores how sleep patterns influence overall health, wellness, and lifestyle habits. By analyzing real-world sleep and health data, the dashboard provides insights into relationships between sleep quality, physical activity, diet, BMI, and disorders.

The aim is to highlight how improving sleep patterns can positively impact recovery, energy levels, and long-term health outcomes.

🎯 Objectives

Identify trends in sleep quality across age and gender groups.

Explore the connection between daily activity (steps, calories burned, physical activity) and sleep.

Understand the impact of dietary habits and medication use on sleep and health.

Examine patterns of sleep disorders and their correlations with health metrics (BMI, chronic conditions, lifestyle).

Provide interactive visualizations for easy exploration of insights.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following key attributes:

Demographics: Age, Gender

Sleep Metrics: Sleep quality, Duration, Bedtime/Wake-up time, Sleep disorders

Health Indicators: BMI, Calories burned, Physical activity, Medication use

Lifestyle Factors: Dietary habits, Daily steps

(Data Source: Public health and wellness dataset; pre-processed for visualization.)

📊 Tableau Dashboards

The project is structured into multiple interactive dashboards:

Age & Gender Sleep Trends – Distribution of sleep quality and duration.

Activity vs. Rest – Relationship between physical activity, daily steps, calories burned, and sleep quality.

Nutrition & Recovery – Analysis of diet patterns and their effect on sleep and health.

Disorders & Medication Impact – Prevalence of sleep disorders, medication usage, and correlations with BMI.

Sleep Rhythm Explorer – Patterns of bedtime, wake-up time, and consistency.

🔍 Key Insights

Younger age groups show irregular sleep schedules, while older groups face higher prevalence of disorders.

Higher physical activity correlates with better sleep quality and lower BMI.

Poor dietary habits and late-night meals show a negative impact on recovery cycles.

Medication reliance increases among those with chronic sleep disorders.

Consistent bedtime and wake-up times lead to significantly better sleep quality.

🚀 Tools & Techniques

Tableau – Data cleaning, dashboard creation, interactive storytelling.
